### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Divyam

I am a 4th year CS student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I am currently working as a Software Development Intern at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). As part of Hacktoberfest 2020, I made some open-source contributions to gitea, a self-hosted Git service. They are viewable [here](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adivbhasin+is%3Aclosed).

I am interested in SWE intern opportunities for Fall 2021.
