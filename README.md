### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Divyam

I am a 3rd year CS student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I am currently a Software Development Intern (Infrastructure) at [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/). As part of Hacktoberfest 2020, I made some open-source contributions to gitea, a self-hosted Git service. The are viewable [here](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adivbhasin+is%3Aclosed).

I am interested in SWE intern opportunities for Summer 2021. Please have a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lgNWuIxkws4GpzHUdW0E3CNc8A5zAwzt/view?usp=sharing) and let me know if there is a fit via the contact methods below.
